1. What is the difference between **getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll**?

Ans: getElementById only works for ID and it returns only one element. getElementsByClassName works for class name. querySelector returns first matching element. querySelectorAll returns all matches.

2. How do you **create and insert a new element into the DOM**?

Ans: At first, document.createElement("tag") and then insert with appendChild() into the parent.

3. What is **Event Bubbling** and how does it work?

Ans: Events start from the target element and go upwards step by step in the DOM tree.

4. What is **Event Delegation** in JavaScript? Why is it useful?

Ans: Event Delegation attaches an event listener to a parent element to handle child child element. It is useful because it saves memory.

5. What is the difference between **preventDefault() and stopPropagation()** methods?

Ans: preventDefault() stops the browser's default behavior and stopPropagation() stops the event from bubbling.
